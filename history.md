# A Brief History of Richland

Among the early settlers in the vicinity were a few Landis families and originally the town was named after them - Landisville. However, there was another Landisville in the adjoining County of Lancaster and this resulted in a confusing situation between the two towns bearing the same name. The name of Richland was selected because of its surroundings and the town soon established for itself an independent reputation.

![Railroad Crossing](./files/img/rr_crossing.png)

The Lebanon Valley Branch of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway was built between 1854 and 1857, and during this time there were three houses in Richland. The first station was a Baggar Car. Two years after the Railroad was completed a permanent Depot was launched, when a grain warehouse was erected by Mr. Stump and Mr. Klopp. The warehouse was destroyed by fire in 1920 at which time it was owned and occupied by C S Kalbach.

In 1858 a Brick Yard, Saw Mill and a Wood Working Mill were established. By 1920 they were no longer in operation.

The first merchant was Edward Landis, who started his enterprise in 1863. He was followed four years later by Mr. Godshalk and Isaac King, of King Bros., and was later succeeded by A.K. Krall.

About the same year Edward Noll started a blacksmith shop and coachworks.

William Noll opened a furniture store and undertaking parlor in 1867.

In 1868 the Band Hall was erected and Allen Bollinger built a distillery. Two hotels came a few years later.

In 1871 the first cigar factory was built and operated by Samuel Klopp. The Hertzler and Kline Cigar factory soon followed.

A tinsmith shop was established by Mr. Stewart in 1872.

The old school house on North Park Street was replaced by a four room school in 1878 under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Zimmerman, who was then one of the Directors. In 1912 a two room High School addition was built by Thomas B Weik, Contractor. Hauer and Mowrey were the Architects.

In 1881, ten years after founding his cigar factory, Samuel Klopp pooled his interest with Isaac Kegerries and started the Klopp and Kegerries Cigar Factory. They also did a business in leaf tobacco. In this plant cigar makers were paid 15 cents per hundred; tobacco strippers received from fifteen to twenty five cents per day, and the forelady was paid two dollars per week.

# History of Services to Richland
